# Autumn Theme for JSON Resume

This is the Autumn theme for [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/). It is built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Development

The theme was started from the [JSON Resume boilerplate theme](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) but I changed the build process for a better interactive development experience for my tastes.

To customize this theme or use this as a template to write your own you will need node.js and NPM installed on your system.

Clone this repository, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and for interactive development run `npm run dev` and you will have the current theme served at localhost:6660. If you add your resume file `resume.json` on the root folder at the project, it will use your resume, otherwise it will be the sample resume provided.

Any changes you make to any file in the `views` and `styles` folders will be reflected in the result (don't forget to refresh the page).
